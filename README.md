# leqaaJamal-ISA-Micro-Architecture-Sample
This project is a sample of an ISA micro Architecture that we made for computer architecture course.
This design that we have created is actually inspired from MIPS.
In this micro architecture implemntation we have handled 14 instruction including jump register and branch less than.
In this project we implemented the concept of pipelining with assuming that there are no hazards.
You may look at the datapath file and scan the Report file to know more about our design and implementation and to know how to use this implementaion.
thank you!
